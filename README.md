# todo-list-app-patrick


### Overview
In this challenge I created a to-do list web application in Rails.  My main goal was to practice building a Ruby on Rails app that was asynchronous using AJAX and JQuery.  Once logged in users can create, edit, delete, and reorder to-do items without reloading the page.

### Application Link



### Features
  - [x] Sign up user
  - [x] Log in user
  - [x] See a list of all the todos for user
  - [x] Create new todos for user
  - [x] Edit a todo description
  - [x] Delete a todo
  - [x] Mark todos as complete or incomplete for user
  - [x] Reorder their todos via drag and drop.

<!-- ### Testing -->
<!-- Tests were created in Rspec for all the requirements listed above.

To run all the rspec tests from the terminal enter the following:

```$ bin/rspec ``` -->




###Technologies Used in this App
  - **Ruby on Rails** as the web application framework
  - **AJAX/ Jquery** for an asynchronous user experience
  - **Jquery UI** to achive drag and drop reordering of todo items.
  - **Rspec and Faker** for integration and controller testing.
  - **Bootstrap** for front-end user interface components
